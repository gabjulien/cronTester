cronTester
==========

Code to test a cron expression

If you want to use the application, you simply supply the cron as the first argument and supply the number of dates you want to be check as the second argument.

If you're a developper, don't forget to add the lib to your project in your IDE.

I'll make a script to build a jar soon.
